# Tony - Discord Bot

>  2nd April 2024

The Aussie BroadWAN has its own Discord bot for it's server. This is open for 
development by members of the small community. This is written in [Go] for no
particular reason than to just improve skills in the language. The bot supports
[App Commands] and channel message "moderation". The Tony framework can be 
extended upon if needed for other kind of bot functionalities.


## How to Run

The first thing you will need to do is create a bot application on discord. This
can be done by following the [Discord Dev Doc]. Once you have made a bot, create
or fetch you Bot Token and put it in a `.env` file.

> **Note:** There is an example `.env` file called `.env.example`, you can 
>           rename this in your directory to `.env` and use that.

Once you have setup your app, bot and added it into a discord server, then you 
are ready to run the program. Eventually there will be binaries avaliable but
for now you can just compile it yourself. You will need `go` installed, if you
don't then go to the [Go Install] docs. Once you have the `go` then you can run
the following in the project directory:

```bash
# Build and Compile the program
go build .

# Run the Program
./tony
```

> **Note:** Future development will move the program into a Docker container for
>           easier deploying, but this is just a rush job to get a basic bot up 
>           and running.
