# Tony - Discord Bot

>  2nd April 2024

The Aussie BroadWAN has its own Discord bot for it's server. This is open for 
development by members of the small community. This is written in [Go] for no
particular reason than to just improve skills in the language. The bot supports
[App Commands] and channel message "moderation". The Tony framework can be 
extended upon if needed for other kind of bot functionalities.


## How to Run

To deploy your own instance of Tony, start by creating a Discord bot 
application. Detailed instructions are available in the [Discord Dev Doc]. 
After setting up your bot, generate a Bot Token and save it in a `.env` file.

> **Note:** Use the provided .env.example as a template. Simply rename it to 
>           `.env` and update its contents accordingly.

Once your bot is configured and added to a server, you're ready to compile and 
run the code. Although future releases might include precompiled binaries, you 
currently need to compile the bot manually. Ensure you have `go` installed by 
consulting the [Go Install] documentation. Then, execute the following commands 
within the project's root directory:

```bash
# Build and Compile the program
go build .

# Run the Program
./tony
```

> **Note:** Remember to load the `.env` file into your environment variables 
>           using a command like `export $(cat .env)`.

### Running Locally with Docker

The instructions below outline how to set up a local environment resembling the 
production setup:

```bash
# Set up a Local Postgres Database
docker network create tony-network
docker pull postgres:latest
docker volume create pgdata
docker run --name postgres                                                     \
    -e POSTGRES_DB=tony                                                        \
    -e POSTGRES_USER=user                                                      \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password                                              \
    --network tony-network                                                     \
    -v pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data                                         \
    -d --restart unless-stopped postgres:latest

# Build the Project (required after every update)
docker build -t tony .
sudo docker run                                                                \
    --env-file .env                                                            \
    --network tony-network                                                     \
    tony                                                                       \
                                                                   \
```

Ensure your `.env` file includes the necessary credentials:

```bash
DISCORD_TOKEN=
DISCORD_SERVER_ID=
DISCORD_STARTUP_CHANNEL=tony-dev

DB_HOST=postgres
DB_NAME=tony
DB_USER=user
DB_PASSWORD=password
```

> **Note:** Make sure to populate the `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `DISCORD_SERVER_ID` 
>           fields with your specific bot details.


## Current Bot Features

There are only two main commands currently with Tony, the rest are application
rules that run on either specific channels or on all.

- `ping`: 
    Sends the user a `Pong @<user>!` message. This is only for testing.

    - `ping button`: Responses with a button which the user can press for the
        same functionality as the `ping` command

- `remind`:
    A system to add deplayed message or reminders for users.

    - `add <time> <message>`: The message to add and when to remind the user
    - `del <id>`: Deletes a message, assuming the user owns the message
    - `status <id>`: Get how much time is left on a reminder
    - `list`: List the ID and times of all the user's reminders

The following here are Application rules and not commands. This means they run
on all messages limited to their registered channels, with the exception of
`autopin` which is registered for all channels.

- `tech-news`:
    A moderation system to ensure posts being made in the `#tech-news` channel 
    is in a specific format.

- `rss`:
    A moderation system to ensure posts being made in the `#rss` channel is in 
    a specifc format.

- `autopin`:
    A reaction system which automatically pins messages if there are 5 or 
    more ðŸ“Œ reacts.
